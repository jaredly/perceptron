# 3.1

- # epochs table
Discuss
- plots of paths taken, no appreciable difference

# 3.3 Stopping criteria

The stopping criteria was as follows: if no progress is made for 20
iterations, then stop. In other words, if the best as of 20 iterations ago is
the same as the current best, then stop. Also, if 100% accuracy was achieved,
then stop as well.

# 3.2 Sep vs Non-sep
- plots of sep vs non-sep (paths). One resolves, while the other one bounces
  around.

# 4 Graph the instances and decision line
- plots of the instances & line

# 5 Voting

## 5.1 graphs of weights

## 5.2 graphs of accuracy

# 6 Iris task

## 6.1
training acc
test acc
num epochs

avg of the above over 5 trials

## 6.3
I did 1 perceptron for each pair of output classes, and implemented voting,
with net values factored in the event of a tie.

# 7
I made an animation of the perceptron.
